    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Gregory Bell and I am a student at the Colorado School of Mines in Computer Science.
        I am expecting to graduate with my B.S. in May 2025 and my M.S. in December 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a software engineer proficient in a wide variety of technologies with a proven track record for reliability.
        I currently do a lot of full stack web development and develop tools for educators to simplify the grading process
        for large classes.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not working, I enjoy running, hiking, and rock climbing, basically anything that gets me outdoors and gets
        my heart rate up.
        I am a passionate teacher having TA'd introductory computer science courses at Mines for 4 years and having helped
        develop course content delivered to over two thousand students.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a firm believer in the power of progress; I always want to be able to took at myself a year down the line
        and be proud of where I am.
    </p>
